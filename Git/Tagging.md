1. First, create a new branch for your authentication changes:

```bash
git checkout -b auth-feature
```

2. Make all your authentication-related changes in this branch.

3. Commit your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Implement Google OAuth and JWT authentication"
```

4. Create a tag for this authentication state:

```bash
git tag Auth
```

5. Push your branch and tag to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin auth-feature
git push origin Auth
```

Now, to revert these changes later:

1. If you're on the auth-feature branch, switch back to the main branch:

```bash
git checkout main
```

2. Create a new branch from the state before the Auth tag:

```bash
git checkout -b pre-auth $(git rev-list -n 1 Auth^)
```

This creates a new branch called 'pre-auth' at the commit just before the Auth tag.

3. If you want to continue working from this pre-authentication state, you can now make new commits on this 'pre-auth' branch.

Alternatively, if you want to temporarily view the code without authentication:

1. You can simply checkout the commit before the Auth tag:

```bash
git checkout Auth^
```

This will put you in a 'detached HEAD' state at the commit just before the Auth tag.

2. When you're done viewing this state, you can go back to your main branch:

```bash
git checkout main
```

By using this approach:
- Your authentication changes are safely stored in the 'auth-feature' branch and the 'Auth' tag.
- You can easily switch between the version with authentication and without.
- For teaching purposes, you can demonstrate the application before and after adding authentication by switching between these branches or tags.

Remember, when you're in a 'detached HEAD' state or on a historical branch, be careful about making new commits. If you need to make changes, it's best to create a new branch from that point.

This setup gives you flexibility in your teaching approach while keeping your repository organized.
