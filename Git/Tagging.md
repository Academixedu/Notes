Tagging.. 

1. First, ensure you're on the auth-feature branch and all changes are committed:

```bash
git checkout auth-feature
git status
# If there are any uncommitted changes, commit them
git add .
git commit -m "Finalize authentication features"
```

2. Switch to the main branch:

```bash
git checkout main
```

3. Merge the auth-feature branch into main:

```bash
git merge auth-feature
```

4. Resolve any merge conflicts if they occur.

5. Once the merge is complete, create a tag for this authentication state:

```bash
git tag Auth
```

6. Push the changes and the new tag to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin main
git push origin Auth
```

Now, to revert these changes later for teaching purposes:

1. You can checkout the state just before the Auth tag:

```bash
git checkout Auth^
```

This will put you in a 'detached HEAD' state at the commit just before the Auth tag.

2. If you want to create a new branch from this state (for example, to make changes):

```bash
git checkout -b pre-auth
```

3. When you're done and want to return to the latest state with authentication:

```bash
git checkout main
```

This approach has several advantages:

1. Your main branch includes the authentication features, which is typically desirable for a complete application.
2. The Auth tag marks the point where authentication was added, making it easy to reference or revert to this state.
3. You can easily switch between the authenticated and non-authenticated versions of your app for teaching purposes.
4. If you need to make changes to the pre-authentication state, you can create a new branch from that point.

Remember, when demonstrating or teaching, you can use commands like `git checkout Auth` to show the state with authentication, and `git checkout Auth^` to show the state just before authentication was added. This allows for a clear before-and-after comparison in your lessons.
