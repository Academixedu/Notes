# Git Reflog Usage Example

Certainly! Here's a complete step-by-step example of using `git reflog` to recover a lost commit. We'll go through the process of making a few commits, accidentally deleting some of them with `git reset --hard`, and then recovering them using `git reflog`.

## Step-by-Step Example

### Step 1: Initialize a Git Repository

First, let's create a new directory and initialize it as a Git repository.

```sh
mkdir git-reflog-example
cd git-reflog-example
git init
```

### Step 2: Make Initial Commits

Create some files and make a few commits.

```sh
echo "Initial content" > file1.txt
git add file1.txt
git commit -m "Initial commit"

echo "More content" > file2.txt
git add file2.txt
git commit -m "Second commit"

echo "Even more content" > file3.txt
git add file3.txt
git commit -m "Third commit"
```

### Step 3: View Commit History

Check the current commit history with `git log`.

```sh
git log
```

You should see three commits listed.

### Step 4: Accidentally Delete Commits

Now, let's simulate accidentally deleting the last two commits.

```sh
git reset --hard HEAD~2
```

This command will move the branch pointer back by two commits, effectively removing the last two commits from the branch history.

### Step 5: Check Commit History Again

Check the commit history again with `git log`.

```sh
git log
```

You should now see only the initial commit listed, as the other two commits have been removed.

### Step 6: Use `git reflog` to Recover Commits

Use `git reflog` to see all reference changes and find the missing commits.

```sh
git reflog
```

You should see a list of actions, including the commits and the recent `reset --hard`. The output will look something like this:

```
abc1234 (HEAD -> master) HEAD@{0}: reset: moving to HEAD~2
def5678 HEAD@{1}: commit: Third commit
ghi9101 HEAD@{2}: commit: Second commit
jkl1121 HEAD@{3}: commit (initial): Initial commit
```

### Step 7: Recover the Lost Commits

Identify the commit hashes for the lost commits (in this example, `def5678` for the third commit and `ghi9101` for the second commit) and reset the branch pointer to the latest lost commit.

```sh
git reset --hard def5678
```

### Step 8: Verify Recovery

Check the commit history again to ensure the commits have been restored.

```sh
git log
```

You should now see all three commits again, indicating that the lost commits have been successfully recovered.

## Summary of Commands

1. Initialize a Git repository:
   ```sh
   git init
   ```

2. Make some commits:
   ```sh
   echo "Initial content" > file1.txt
   git add file1.txt
   git commit -m "Initial commit"

   echo "More content" > file2.txt
   git add file2.txt
   git commit -m "Second commit"

   echo "Even more content" > file3.txt
   git add file3.txt
   git commit -m "Third commit"
   ```

3. Check commit history:
   ```sh
   git log
   ```

4. Accidentally delete commits:
   ```sh
   git reset --hard HEAD~2
   ```

5. Check commit history again:
   ```sh
   git log
   ```

6. Use `git reflog` to find lost commits:
   ```sh
   git reflog
   ```

7. Recover the lost commits:
   ```sh
   git reset --hard <commit-hash>
   ```

8. Verify recovery:
   ```sh
   git log
   ```

By following these steps, you can effectively use `git reflog` to recover lost commits and understand how reference changes are tracked in your Git repository.
