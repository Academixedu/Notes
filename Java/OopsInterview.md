### Inheritance and Interfaces

1. **Question: Explain how inheritance is demonstrated in the `AdminUser` and `GroupAdmin` classes.**
   - **Answer:** The `AdminUser` and `GroupAdmin` classes extend the `User` class, inheriting its fields and methods. This allows them to reuse the common functionality provided by the `User` class and add their specific behaviors.

2. **Question: Describe how the `AdminActions` interface extends the `UserActions` interface.**
   - **Answer:** The `AdminActions` interface extends the `UserActions` interface, meaning it inherits all the methods declared in `UserActions` and can add additional methods specific to admin users, such as `approvePost` and `banUser`.

3. **Question: What are the benefits of using interfaces in this scenario?**
   - **Answer:** Interfaces allow for a more flexible and modular design. They enable different classes to implement the same set of actions in their unique ways, promoting code reuse and reducing coupling between components.

4. **Question: How would you modify the `AdminUser` class to add a new method for updating user details?**
   - **Answer:** You can add a new method `updateUserDetails(int userId, String username, String email)` in the `AdminUser` class that allows updating the user details based on the provided parameters.

5. **Question: Can an interface extend multiple interfaces in Java? Provide an example using the `UserActions` and `AdminActions` interfaces.**
   - **Answer:** Yes, an interface can extend multiple interfaces in Java. Example:
     ```java
     public interface SuperAdminActions extends UserActions, AdminActions {
         void viewAllUsers();
     }
     ```

### Polymorphism

6. **Question: Define polymorphism and explain how it is utilized in the `BlogApp` class.**
   - **Answer:** Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass or interface. In `BlogApp`, both `UserActions` and `AdminActions` interfaces are used to handle different user types polymorphically in methods like `performUserActions` and `performAdminActions`.

7. **Question: How does the `performUserActions` method demonstrate polymorphism?**
   - **Answer:** The `performUserActions` method accepts any object that implements the `UserActions` interface, allowing it to perform actions on different user types (e.g., `RegularUser`, `AdminUser`, `GroupAdmin`) without knowing their specific class.

8. **Question: Describe the benefits of using polymorphism in software development.**
   - **Answer:** Polymorphism enables flexibility and reusability in code, allowing developers to write more generic and maintainable code. It simplifies the addition of new classes and behaviors without altering existing code.

9. **Question: How would you modify the `BlogApp` class to add a new method for handling comments on posts using polymorphism?**
   - **Answer:** Add a new method `performCommentActions(UserActions user, String comment)` in `BlogApp`, where `UserActions` is extended with a method like `addComment(String comment)`.

10. **Question: Explain the difference between compile-time and runtime polymorphism, providing examples from the code.**
    - **Answer:** Compile-time polymorphism (method overloading) occurs when multiple methods have the same name but different parameters. Runtime polymorphism (method overriding) occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass or interface, as seen in the `AdminUser` and `GroupAdmin` classes.

### Encapsulation

11. **Question: What is encapsulation and how is it implemented in the `User` class?**
    - **Answer:** Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, typically a class. In the `User` class, encapsulation is implemented by making fields private and providing public getter methods.

12. **Question: Why is it important to make the fields of the `User` class private?**
    - **Answer:** Making fields private restricts direct access to them, protecting the internal state of the object from unauthorized access and modifications. It ensures that any changes to the fields are controlled and validated.

13. **Question: How does encapsulation help in protecting the state of an object?**
    - **Answer:** Encapsulation helps by restricting access to the internal state of an object and exposing only necessary operations through public methods, ensuring that the object's state can only be modified in a controlled manner.

14. **Question: Provide an example of how encapsulation is used in the `Post` class.**
    - **Answer:** In the `Post` class, fields like `postId`, `title`, `content`, and `approved` are private. Public methods like `getPostId()`, `getTitle()`, `getContent()`, `isApproved()`, and `setContent(String content)` provide controlled access to these fields.

15. **Question: How would you add a new private field to the `User` class and provide access to it?**
    - **Answer:** Add a new private field `private String phoneNumber;` and provide a public getter method `public String getPhoneNumber()` and setter method `public void setPhoneNumber(String phoneNumber)`.

### Abstraction

16. **Question: Define abstraction and explain its role in the provided code.**
    - **Answer:** Abstraction is the concept of hiding the implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object. In the provided code, interfaces `UserActions` and `AdminActions` define abstract methods without specifying their implementations.

17. **Question: How do the `UserActions` and `AdminActions` interfaces contribute to abstraction in the application?**
    - **Answer:** These interfaces define a set of actions that can be performed by users and admins, respectively. They provide a clear contract for what actions are possible without detailing how these actions are implemented.

18. **Question: What are the advantages of using abstraction in software design?**
    - **Answer:** Abstraction simplifies complex systems by providing clear interfaces, improves code readability, promotes code reuse, and allows for easier maintenance and scalability.

19. **Question: Provide an example of how you would add a new abstract method to the `UserActions` interface.**
    - **Answer:** Add a new method to `UserActions`:
      ```java
      public interface UserActions {
          void writePost(String title, String content);
          void editPost(int postId, String content);
          void deletePost(int postId);
          void greetAction();
          void addComment(String comment);  // New abstract method
      }
      ```

20. **Question: How does abstraction help in managing the complexity of the `BlogApp`?**
    - **Answer:** Abstraction allows developers to focus on high-level interactions without worrying about specific implementations. It reduces complexity by dividing the application into smaller, more manageable pieces with clear interfaces.

### Method Overriding

21. **Question: What is method overriding and how is it used in the `AdminUser` and `GroupAdmin` classes?**
    - **Answer:** Method overriding is when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass or interface. In the `AdminUser` and `GroupAdmin` classes, methods like `writePost`, `editPost`, and `deletePost` override the implementations from the `UserActions` interface.

22. **Question: Provide examples of method overriding from the provided code.**
    - **Answer:** Examples include:
      - `AdminUser.writePost(String title, String content)`
      - `GroupAdmin.writePost(String title, String content)`
      - `AdminUser.editPost(int postId, String content)`
      - `GroupAdmin.editPost(int postId, String content)`

23. **Question: Why is method overriding important in object-oriented programming?**
    - **Answer:** Method overriding allows subclasses to provide specific behavior for methods defined in a parent class or interface. It enables polymorphism and promotes a more flexible and reusable design.

24. **Question: How would you override the `approvePost` method in the `GroupAdmin` class to add additional functionality?**
    - **Answer:** Override the method in `GroupAdmin` and add the additional functionality:
      ```java
      @Override
      public void approvePost(int postId) {
          super.approvePost(postId);
          System.out.println(getUsername() + " logs approval action for post ID: " + postId + " in group " + groupName);
      }
      ```

25. **Question: What is the difference between method overriding and method overloading?**
    - **Answer:** Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method defined in its superclass or interface, maintaining the same method signature. Method overloading occurs when multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters.

### Design Principles

26. **Question: Explain how the Single Responsibility Principle is applied in the `User`, `AdminUser`, and `GroupAdmin` classes.**
    - **Answer:** Each class has a specific responsibility: `User` handles basic user information, `AdminUser` adds admin-specific actions, and `GroupAdmin` adds group-specific admin actions. This separation ensures each class has only one reason to change.

27. **Question: How does the Open/Closed Principle apply to the `AdminActions` interface?**
    - **Answer:** The `AdminActions` interface is open for extension (new methods can be added in the future) but closed for modification (existing functionality does not need to be changed to add new behaviors).

28. **Question: Describe how the Liskov Substitution Principle is demonstrated in the `performUserActions` and `perform

AdminActions` methods.**
    - **Answer:** The Liskov Substitution Principle is demonstrated as objects of subclasses (`RegularUser`, `AdminUser`, `GroupAdmin`) can be substituted for objects of the superclass (`UserActions` or `AdminActions`) without affecting the correctness of the program.

29. **Question: How does the Interface Segregation Principle apply to the `UserActions` and `AdminActions` interfaces?**
    - **Answer:** The `UserActions` interface provides basic user actions, while the `AdminActions` interface extends it with admin-specific actions. This segregation ensures that users only implement the interfaces relevant to their roles.

30. **Question: Provide an example of how the Dependency Inversion Principle can be applied to the `BlogApp`.**
    - **Answer:** Dependency Inversion Principle can be applied by introducing abstractions for dependencies. For example, `BlogApp` can depend on `UserActions` and `AdminActions` interfaces rather than concrete implementations, promoting flexibility and reducing coupling.

### Practical Application

31. **Question: How would you extend the `BlogApp` to include a new type of user, such as a Moderator, with specific actions?**
    - **Answer:** Create a new `ModeratorActions` interface extending `UserActions`, and a `ModeratorUser` class implementing `ModeratorActions` with specific methods like `moderateComment`.

32. **Question: Describe how you would implement a new feature to allow users to like posts.**
    - **Answer:** Add a `likePost(int postId)` method to the `UserActions` interface and implement it in the `RegularUser`, `AdminUser`, and `GroupAdmin` classes.

33. **Question: How would you handle exceptions in the `writePost` method to ensure robust error handling?**
    - **Answer:** Use a try-catch block to handle exceptions and provide meaningful error messages:
      ```java
      @Override
      public void writePost(String title, String content) {
          try {
              // logic to write post
          } catch (Exception e) {
              System.out.println("Error writing post: " + e.getMessage());
          }
      }
      ```

34. **Question: Explain how you would refactor the `performAdminActions` method to support additional actions without modifying existing code.**
    - **Answer:** Use a command pattern where each action is encapsulated as an object, allowing new actions to be added easily without modifying existing code.

35. **Question: How would you implement a logging mechanism to track user actions in the `BlogApp`?**
    - **Answer:** Introduce a logging utility class and use it in methods to log actions:
      ```java
      public class Logger {
          public static void log(String message) {
              System.out.println("LOG: " + message);
          }
      }
      ```

### Advanced Concepts

36. **Question: What is the significance of the `super` keyword in the `AdminUser` and `GroupAdmin` constructors?**
    - **Answer:** The `super` keyword is used to call the constructor of the superclass (`User`) to initialize inherited fields.

37. **Question: How would you implement a singleton pattern for managing the `BlogApp` instance?**
    - **Answer:** Create a singleton class:
      ```java
      public class BlogAppSingleton {
          private static BlogAppSingleton instance;
          private BlogAppSingleton() {}
          public static BlogAppSingleton getInstance() {
              if (instance == null) {
                  instance = new BlogAppSingleton();
              }
              return instance;
          }
      }
      ```

38. **Question: Explain how generics could be used to enhance the flexibility of the `performUserActions` method.**
    - **Answer:** Use generics to accept any type that extends `UserActions`:
      ```java
      public static <T extends UserActions> void performUserActions(T user, String title, String content) {
          user.writePost(title, content);
      }
      ```

39. **Question: Describe how dependency injection could be applied to manage dependencies in the `BlogApp`.**
    - **Answer:** Use a dependency injection framework (like Spring) to inject dependencies:
      ```java
      @Autowired
      private UserActions userActions;
      ```

40. **Question: How would you use reflection to dynamically invoke methods in the `AdminUser` class?**
    - **Answer:** Use Java reflection to invoke methods dynamically:
      ```java
      Method method = adminUser.getClass().getMethod("approvePost", int.class);
      method.invoke(adminUser, postId);
      ```

### Code Optimization

41. **Question: How would you optimize the `writePost` method to improve performance?**
    - **Answer:** Optimize by minimizing I/O operations and using efficient data structures. For example, use StringBuilder for string concatenation.

42. **Question: Describe how you would use design patterns to enhance the scalability of the `BlogApp`.**
    - **Answer:** Use design patterns like Factory for object creation, Strategy for dynamic behavior changes, and Observer for event handling.

43. **Question: Explain the trade-offs between using inheritance and composition in the `AdminUser` and `GroupAdmin` classes.**
    - **Answer:** Inheritance provides a clear hierarchy and reuses code, but it can lead to tight coupling and less flexibility. Composition offers more flexibility by combining behaviors, but it can increase complexity.

44. **Question: How would you refactor the `GroupAdmin` class to reduce code duplication with the `AdminUser` class?**
    - **Answer:** Extract common behavior into a separate class and use composition:
      ```java
      public class AdminOperations {
          // common methods for admin operations
      }
      ```

45. **Question: What are the potential security concerns in the `BlogApp` and how would you address them?**
    - **Answer:** Potential concerns include unauthorized access and data breaches. Address them by implementing authentication, authorization, input validation, and secure coding practices.

### Testing and Maintenance

46. **Question: How would you write unit tests for the `editPost` method in the `RegularUser` class?**
    - **Answer:** Use a testing framework like JUnit to write unit tests:
      ```java
      @Test
      public void testEditPost() {
          RegularUser user = new RegularUser(1, "JohnDoe", "john@example.com");
          user.editPost(1, "New content");
          // assert statements to verify behavior
      }
      ```

47. **Question: Describe how you would use mocking to test the `approvePost` method in the `AdminUser` class.**
    - **Answer:** Use a mocking framework like Mockito to mock dependencies:
      ```java
      @Test
      public void testApprovePost() {
          AdminUser admin = Mockito.mock(AdminUser.class);
          admin.approvePost(1);
          Mockito.verify(admin).approvePost(1);
      }
      ```

48. **Question: Explain the importance of code documentation and how you would document the `User` class.**
    - **Answer:** Code documentation provides clarity and helps maintainability. Document the `User` class using Javadoc:
      ```java
      /**
       * Represents a user in the blog application.
       */
      public class User {
          // fields and methods
      }
      ```

49. **Question: How would you ensure the maintainability of the `BlogApp` as it evolves over time?**
    - **Answer:** Ensure maintainability by following coding standards, writing comprehensive tests, documenting code, and using version control and continuous integration practices.

50. **Question: Describe how you would implement continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) for the `BlogApp`.**
    - **Answer:** Set up a CI/CD pipeline using tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions. Automate build, test, and deployment processes to ensure code quality and faster delivery.
