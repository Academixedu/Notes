### **Day 1: Introduction to Java Programming and Basic Constructs (2 Hours)**

#### **Objective:**
- Understand the basic structure of a Java program.
- Learn how to declare and initialize variables.
- Understand basic data types and how to print output.

#### **Schedule:**

**First Hour:**

1. **Introduction to Java (10 minutes):**
    - Brief history and importance of Java.
    - Applications of Java in real-world scenarios.
    - Overview of the Java Development Kit (JDK) and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and VS Code.

2. **Basic Structure of a Java Program (15 minutes):**
    - Explain the `public class` and `public static void main(String[] args)` structure.
    - Discuss the role of the main method as the entry point of a Java application.

    **Example:**
    ```java
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
    ```

3. **Live Coding Session (15 minutes):**
    - Demonstrate writing the "Hello, World!" program.
    - Show how to compile and run the program using an IDE.

    **Steps:**
    - Open your chosen IDE.
    - Create a new Java project and a new class named `Main`.
    - Write the "Hello, World!" program and run it to display the output.

4. **Hands-on Practice (20 minutes):**
    - Students create their own "Hello, World!" program.
    - Walk around and assist students as needed.
    - Encourage students to experiment with modifying the output message.

**Second Hour:**

5. **Introduction to Variables and Data Types (15 minutes):**
    - Explain what variables are and why they are used.
    - Discuss different data types: `String`, `int`, `double`, `boolean`, etc.
    - Show how to declare and initialize variables.

    **Example:**
    ```java
    String name = "John";
    int age = 25;
    double score = 85.5;
    boolean isJavaFun = true;
    ```

6. **Live Coding Session (15 minutes):**
    - Add variables to the "Hello, World!" program.
    - Demonstrate how to print variable values using `System.out.println`.

    **Example:**
    ```java
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello, World!");

            String name = "John";
            int age = 25;
            double score = 85.5;

            System.out.println("Name: " + name);
            System.out.println("Age: " + age);
            System.out.println("Score: " + score);
        }
    }
    ```

7. **Hands-on Practice (20 minutes):**
    - Students modify their "Hello, World!" program to include variables of different data types.
    - Assist students as they write and run their programs.
    - Encourage students to experiment with different data types and values.

8. **Q&A Session (10 minutes):**
    - Open the floor for any questions related to the topics covered.
    - Clarify any doubts and provide additional examples if needed.

9. **Recap and Summary (5 minutes):**
    - Review key points covered during the session.
    - Emphasize the importance of understanding the basic structure, variables, and data types as the foundation for further learning.
