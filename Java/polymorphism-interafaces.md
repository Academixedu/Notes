1. Interfaces and Polymorphism:
   - An interface defines a contract of methods that a class must implement.
   - Interfaces enable polymorphism by allowing different classes to implement the same interface.
   - This means objects of different classes can be treated uniformly if they implement the same interface.

2. How They Work Together:
   - Interfaces provide a common type that different classes can adhere to.
   - Polymorphism allows us to use these different classes through their common interface.

3. Benefits of This Relationship:
   - Code Flexibility: You can write methods that accept an interface type, allowing them to work with any class implementing that interface.
   - Loose Coupling: Your code depends on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations.
   - Extensibility: New classes can be easily integrated as long as they implement the required interface.

Here's a simple example to illustrate:

```java
interface Shape {
    double getArea();
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    private double radius;
    
    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }
    
    @Override
    public double getArea() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    private double width;
    private double height;
    
    public Rectangle(double width, double height) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }
    
    @Override
    public double getArea() {
        return width * height;
    }
}

// Using polymorphism
public void printArea(Shape shape) {
    System.out.println("Area: " + shape.getArea());
}

// Usage
Circle circle = new Circle(5);
Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle(4, 6);

printArea(circle);      // Works with Circle
printArea(rectangle);   // Works with Rectangle
```

In this example, the `Shape` interface allows for polymorphic behavior. The `printArea` method can work with any object that implements the `Shape` interface, demonstrating how interfaces and polymorphism work together to create flexible and extensible code.
