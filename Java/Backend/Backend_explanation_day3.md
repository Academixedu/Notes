1. HTTP Request:
   A client sends a POST request to `/api/users` with a JSON body containing user details.

2. Controller:
   The request is routed to the `UserController` class because of the `@RequestMapping("/api/users")` annotation.
   
   ```java
   @RestController
   @RequestMapping("/api/users")
   public class UserController {
       @Autowired
       private UserService userService;

       @PostMapping
       public User createUser(@RequestBody User user) {
           return userService.createUser(user);
       }
   }
   ```

   The `@PostMapping` annotation on the `createUser` method means it handles POST requests to this endpoint.

3. Dependency Injection:
   Notice the `@Autowired` annotation on `private UserService userService;`. This is where Spring's dependency injection happens. 
   
   - Spring creates an instance of `UserService` and injects it into this controller.
   - This is possible because `UserService` is annotated with `@Service`, marking it as a bean to be managed by Spring.

4. Request Body Conversion:
   The `@RequestBody` annotation on the `createUser` method parameter tells Spring to convert the JSON in the request body to a `User` object.

5. Service Layer:
   The controller calls `userService.createUser(user)`, passing the User object to the service layer.

   ```java
   @Service
   public class UserService {
       @Autowired
       private UserRepository userRepository;

       public User createUser(User user) {
           return userRepository.save(user);
       }
   }
   ```

   - The `@Service` annotation marks this as a service bean, allowing it to be autowired into the controller.
   - Here, `UserRepository` is autowired into the service, similar to how the service was autowired into the controller.

6. Repository Layer:
   The service calls `userRepository.save(user)`.

   ```java
   public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Integer> {
   }
   ```

   - `UserRepository` extends `JpaRepository`, which provides the `save` method.
   - Spring Data JPA creates an implementation of this interface at runtime.

7. Database Interaction:
   The `save` method persists the User entity to the database.

8. Response:
   - The saved user (now with an ID) is returned back up through the layers: Repository → Service → Controller.
   - The controller returns this User object, which Spring automatically converts back to JSON.

9. HTTP Response:
   The JSON representation of the saved user is sent back to the client in the HTTP response.

This flow demonstrates how Spring's dependency injection and annotations work together to create a clean, modular architecture:

- `@RestController`, `@Service`, and `@Repository` annotations define the roles of different components.
- `@Autowired` enables dependency injection, allowing Spring to manage object creation and lifecycle.
- Spring Boot's auto-configuration sets up a lot of this automatically, reducing boilerplate code.

This architecture makes the application easier to test, maintain, and scale, as each component has a clear, single responsibility.
