1. HTTP Request:
   A client sends a POST request to `/api/users` with a JSON body containing user details.

2. Controller:
   The request is routed to the `UserController` class because of the `@RequestMapping("/api/users")` annotation.
   
   ```java
   @RestController
   @RequestMapping("/api/users")
   public class UserController {
       @Autowired
       private UserService userService;

       @PostMapping
       public User createUser(@RequestBody User user) {
           return userService.createUser(user);
       }
   }
   ```

   The `@PostMapping` annotation on the `createUser` method means it handles POST requests to this endpoint.

3. Dependency Injection:
   Notice the `@Autowired` annotation on `private UserService userService;`. This is where Spring's dependency injection happens. 
   
   - Spring creates an instance of `UserService` and injects it into this controller.
   - This is possible because `UserService` is annotated with `@Service`, marking it as a bean to be managed by Spring.

4. Request Body Conversion:
   The `@RequestBody` annotation on the `createUser` method parameter tells Spring to convert the JSON in the request body to a `User` object.

5. Service Layer:
   The controller calls `userService.createUser(user)`, passing the User object to the service layer.

   ```java
   @Service
   public class UserService {
       @Autowired
       private UserRepository userRepository;

       public User createUser(User user) {
           return userRepository.save(user);
       }
   }
   ```

   - The `@Service` annotation marks this as a service bean, allowing it to be autowired into the controller.
   - Here, `UserRepository` is autowired into the service, similar to how the service was autowired into the controller.

6. Repository Layer:
   The service calls `userRepository.save(user)`.

   ```java
   public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Integer> {
   }
   ```

   - `UserRepository` extends `JpaRepository`, which provides the `save` method.
   - Spring Data JPA creates an implementation of this interface at runtime.

7. Database Interaction:
   The `save` method persists the User entity to the database.

8. Response:
   - The saved user (now with an ID) is returned back up through the layers: Repository → Service → Controller.
   - The controller returns this User object, which Spring automatically converts back to JSON.

9. HTTP Response:
   The JSON representation of the saved user is sent back to the client in the HTTP response.

This flow demonstrates how Spring's dependency injection and annotations work together to create a clean, modular architecture:

- `@RestController`, `@Service`, and `@Repository` annotations define the roles of different components.
- `@Autowired` enables dependency injection, allowing Spring to manage object creation and lifecycle.
- Spring Boot's auto-configuration sets up a lot of this automatically, reducing boilerplate code.

This architecture makes the application easier to test, maintain, and scale, as each component has a clear, single responsibility.

To determine what data you need to send in Postman for the user creation API, let's reverse engineer the process step by step:

1. Examine the Controller:
   In UserController.java, we see:

   ```java
   @PostMapping
   public User createUser(@RequestBody User user) {
       return userService.createUser(user);
   }
   ```

   This tells us we're sending a User object in the request body.

2. Inspect the User Model:
   In User.java, we find:

   ```java
   public class User {
       @Id
       @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
       private int userId;
       private String username;
       private String email;
       // getters and setters
   }
   ```

3. Analyze the Fields:
   - userId: This is annotated with @Id and @GeneratedValue, meaning it's automatically generated. We don't need to send this.
   - username: This is a String field we need to provide.
   - email: This is another String field we need to provide.

4. Check for Required Fields:
   There are no annotations like @NotNull or @Column(nullable = false), so we can't be certain if any fields are required. In a real-world scenario, you'd want to check the database schema or ask the developers.

5. Determine the JSON Structure:
   Based on the User class, our JSON should look like:

   ```json
   {
     "username": "some_username",
     "email": "user@example.com"
   }
   ```

6. Set Up Postman:
   - Method: POST
   - URL: http://[your-base-url]/api/users
   - Headers: Content-Type: application/json
   - Body: Raw, JSON

   ```json
   {
     "username": "john_doe",
     "email": "john@example.com"
   }
   ```

7. Additional Considerations:
   - The actual endpoint URL depends on where your application is hosted.
   - There might be validation logic in the service layer that isn't immediately apparent from the model.
   - In a production app, you'd typically have more fields like password, and you'd use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) instead of exposing entity classes directly.

By following these steps, we've determined the minimum data required for the API call. However, always refer to API documentation when available, as it would provide the most accurate and complete information about required and optional fields, validation rules, and expected responses.
