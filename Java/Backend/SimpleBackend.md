Step 1: Set Up Your Project

Why: We need to create a new project with all the necessary tools.

How:

1. Go to https://start.spring.io/
2. Choose:
   - Project: Maven
   - Language: Java
   - Spring Boot: Latest stable version
   - Group: com.example
   - Artifact: helloapp
3. Add Dependency: Spring Web
4. Click "Generate" and download the zip file
5. Unzip the file and open it in your favorite code editor

Think of this like getting a new box of LEGO bricks to build with.

Step 2: Understand the Project Structure

Why: We need to know where to put our code.

How: Look at the folders in your project:

- src/main/java: This is where we put our Java code
- src/main/resources: This is where we put other files our app might need
- pom.xml: This file tells our app what tools (dependencies) it can use

It's like organizing your LEGO bricks before you start building.

Step 3: Create a Hello Controller

Why: We need to tell our app how to say "Hello" when someone asks.

How: Create a new file called HelloController.java in src/main/java/com/example/helloapp and add this code:

```java
package com.example.helloapp;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class HelloController {

    @GetMapping("/")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
}
```

This is like creating a special LEGO brick that says "Hello" when you touch it.

Step 4: Understand the Main Application Class

Why: We need to know how our app starts.

How: Open the HelloappApplication.java file. It should look like this:

```java
package com.example.helloapp;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class HelloappApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(HelloappApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

This is like the instruction manual for our LEGO set. It tells the computer how to start our app.

Step 5: Run Your Application

Why: We want to see our app in action!

How:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt
2. Navigate to your project folder
3. Run this command: `./mvnw spring-boot:run` (on Windows, use `mvnw spring-boot:run`)

It's like pressing the "On" button for our LEGO creation.

Step 6: Test Your Application

Why: We want to make sure our app is working correctly.

How:

1. Open a web browser
2. Go to http://localhost:8080
3. You should see "Hello, World!" displayed

It's like playing with our LEGO creation to make sure it does what we want.

Explanation of Key Concepts:

1. @SpringBootApplication: This is a special label we put on our main class. It tells Spring Boot, "This is where everything starts!"

2. @RestController: This label tells Spring, "This class will handle web requests."

3. @GetMapping("/"): This says, "When someone visits the home page, use this method."

4. SpringApplication.run(): This is the magic spell that starts our Spring Boot app.

5. Maven: This is a tool that helps us manage our project and its dependencies. The pom.xml file is its instruction manual.

6. Embedded Server: Spring Boot includes a web server (Tomcat) right in our app, so we don't need to install one separately.

Congratulations! You've just created your first Spring Boot application. This simple app demonstrates the basics of how Spring Boot works:

- It automatically configures many things for us
- It makes it easy to create web endpoints
- It includes an embedded web server so we can run our app easily

As you build more complex applications, you'll add more controllers, services, and maybe even connect to databases. But the core concept remains the same: Spring Boot does a lot of the hard work for us, so we can focus on writing our application logic.
