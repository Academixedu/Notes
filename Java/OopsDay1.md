Planning a project involves several steps, from initial conceptualization to final implementation and deployment. Here's a detailed plan for your blog application project, including class designs, actions, and an implementation roadmap:

### Step 1: Requirements Gathering
Identify the core features your blog application should have:
- User registration and authentication
- Creating, editing, deleting posts
- Admin approval of posts
- Banning users
- Group management (for group admins)
- Viewing posts

### Step 2: Define the Domain Model
Identify the key entities in your application and their relationships:
- **User**: Base class for all users
- **RegularUser**: Inherits from User and performs basic actions
- **AdminUser**: Inherits from User and performs admin actions
- **GroupAdmin**: Inherits from User and performs group-specific admin actions
- **Post**: Represents a blog post

### Step 3: Define Actions
Define the actions each type of user can perform:
- **UserActions**: Interface for common user actions
- **AdminActions**: Interface for admin-specific actions

### Step 4: Design the Classes
Design the main classes and interfaces:

1. **UserActions Interface**:
   ```java
   package com.example.blogapp;

   public interface UserActions {
       Post writePost(String title, String content);
       void editPost(Post post, String content);
       void deletePost(Post post);
   }
   ```

2. **AdminActions Interface**:
   ```java
   package com.example.blogapp;

   public interface AdminActions extends UserActions {
       void approvePost(Post post);
       void banUser(User user);
   }
   ```

### Step 5: Implementation Roadmap

1. **Setup Development Environment**:
   - Install Java Development Kit (JDK)
   - Set up an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

2. **Project Initialization**:
   - Create a new Java project
   - Set up the package structure (`com.example.blogapp`)

3. **Implement Core Classes**:
   - Implement `User`, `Post`, `UserActions`, and `AdminActions` interfaces
   - Implement `RegularUser`, `AdminUser`, and `GroupAdmin` classes

4. **Build and Test Basic Features**:
   - Implement methods in `RegularUser` for writing, editing, and deleting posts
   - Implement methods in `AdminUser` for approving posts and banning users
   - Implement group-specific methods in `GroupAdmin`

5. **User Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Implement user registration and login functionality
   - Ensure that actions are properly restricted based on user roles

6. **Database Integration**:
   - Choose a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
   - Set up database tables for users and posts
   - Implement data access layer (using JDBC, JPA, Hibernate, etc.)

7. **Front-End Development**:
   - Set up a front-end project using React
   - Implement components for viewing, creating, editing, and deleting posts
   - Integrate with the back-end using REST APIs

8. **Advanced Features**:
   - Implement admin dashboard for managing posts and users
   - Add search and filter functionality for posts
   - Implement notifications for post approvals and user bans

9. **Testing and Deployment**:
   - Write unit and integration tests
   - Deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku)
   - Ensure the application is scalable and secure

10. **Maintenance and Updates**:
   - Monitor application performance
   - Regularly update the application with new features and bug fixes
