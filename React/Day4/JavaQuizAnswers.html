### Question 1
**What is the purpose of the `public static void main(String[] args)` method in a Java program?**

- **Correct Answer: "It is the entry point of any Java application."**
  - **Explanation:** The `main` method is the entry point of any Java application. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) calls this method to start the execution of the program.
- **Other Options:**
  - "It is used to declare global variables."
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because the `main` method does not declare global variables; it serves as the entry point.
  - "It defines a class in Java."
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect. A class in Java is defined using the `class` keyword, not the `main` method.
  - "It is used to print output to the console."
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect. While `System.out.println` within the `main` method can print to the console, the purpose of the `main` method itself is not to print output.

### Question 2
**Which of the following is a correct way to declare and initialize a variable in Java?**

- **Correct Answer: "boolean isJavaFun = true;"**
  - **Explanation:** This is the correct way to declare and initialize a boolean variable in Java.
- **Other Options:**
  - "int number = \"10\";"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because `10` is a string here, not an integer. The correct way would be `int number = 10;`.
  - "String name = John;"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because `John` is not enclosed in double quotes. The correct way would be `String name = "John";`.
  - "double value = \"25.5\";"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because `25.5` is a string here, not a double. The correct way would be `double value = 25.5;`.

### Question 3
**What will be the output of the following code snippet?**
```java
int age = 18;
if (age >= 18) {
    System.out.println("You are eligible to vote.");
} else {
    System.out.println("You are not eligible to vote.");
}
```

- **Correct Answer: "You are eligible to vote."**
  - **Explanation:** The condition `age >= 18` evaluates to true since `age` is 18. Therefore, the `if` block is executed.
- **Other Options:**
  - "You are not eligible to vote."
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because the condition `age >= 18` is true.
  - "Compilation error."
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because the code is syntactically correct.
  - "Runtime error."
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because there is no runtime error in the code.

### Question 4

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("Count: " + i);
}
```

- **Correct Answer: "5 times"**
  - **Explanation:** The loop will execute 5 times with `i` taking values from 0 to 4.
- **Other Options:**
  - "4 times"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because the loop includes `0`, so it runs 5 times, not 4.
  - "6 times"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because the loop stops when `i` reaches 5.
  - "Infinite times"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because the loop has a termination condition `i < 5`.

### Question 5
**What is the return type of the following method?**
```java
public static int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

- **Correct Answer: "int"**
  - **Explanation:** The return type of the `add` method is `int` as specified in its declaration.
- **Other Options:**
  - "void"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because `void` means no return value, but the method returns an `int`.
  - "double"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because the method returns an `int`, not a `double`.
  - "String"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because the method returns an `int`, not a `String`.

### Question 6
**Which of the following data types would you use to store a person's age?**

- **Correct Answer: "int"**

### Question 7
**What will be the output of the following code snippet?**
```java
int x = 5;
System.out.println(x++);
```

- **Correct Answer: "5"**
  - **Explanation:** The `x++` operation is a post-increment, so the value of `x` (5) is printed before it is incremented to 6.
- **Other Options:**
  - "4"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because `x` starts at 5.
  - "6"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because the increment happens after the value is printed.

  - **Explanation:** This is a valid constructor for a class named `Example`.
- **Other Options:**
  - "public void Example() {}"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because constructors do not have a return type, not even `void`.
  - "void Example() {}"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because constructors do not have a return type and must be `public`.
  - "Example() {}"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because constructors should have an access modifier, typically `public`.

### Question 13
**What is the output of the following code?**
```java
System.out.println("Hello" + 5 + 3);
```

- **Correct Answer: "Hello53"**
  - **Explanation:** The `+` operator is evaluated left to right, so `"Hello"` + `5` results in `"Hello5"`, and then `"Hello5"` + `3` results in `"Hello53"`.
- **Other Options:**
  - "

Hello8"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because the `+` operator concatenates the numbers as strings, not adds them arithmetically.

    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because `static` defines class-level variables, not constants.
  - "define"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because `define` is not a keyword in Java.

### Question 46
**What is the output of the following code?**
```java
int x = 10;
int y = 5;
int z = x / y;
System.out.println(z);
```

- **Correct Answer: "2"**
  - **Explanation:** The division of `10` by `5` results in `2`.
- **Other Options:**
  - "5"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because the result of the division is `2`, not `5`.

**What will be the output of the following code?**
```java
int x = 5;
System.out.println(++x);
```

- **Correct Answer: "6"**
  - **Explanation:** The pre-increment `++x` increments the value of `x` to `6` before printing it.
- **Other Options:**
  - "5"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because the pre-increment increases the value before printing.
  - "4"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because the initial value of `x` is `5`, and it is incremented to `6`.
  - "Compilation error"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because the code is syntactically correct.

### Question 48
**Which of the following is used to declare a variable that cannot be changed?**

- **Correct Answer: "final"**
  - **Explanation:** The `final` keyword is used to declare a constant variable that cannot be changed.
- **Other Options:**
  - "constant"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because `constant` is not a keyword in Java.
  - "static"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because `static` defines class-level variables, not immutable variables.
  - "immutable"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because `immutable` is not a keyword in Java.

### Question 49
**Which of the following is the correct way to declare a float variable in Java?**

- **Correct Answer: "float f = 1.0f;"**
  - **Explanation:** The `f` suffix is necessary to indicate that the literal is a float.
- **Other Options:**
  - "float f = 1.0;"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because `1.0` is a double by default, not a float.
  - "float f = \"1.0\";"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because `"1.0"` is a string, not a float.
  - "float f = 1;"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because `1` is an integer, not a float.

### Question 50
**Which of the following is used to print output to the console in Java?**

- **Correct Answer: "System.out.println()"**
  - **Explanation:** The `System.out.println()` method is used to print output to the console.
- **Other Options:**
  - "System.out.print()"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because `System.out.print()` does not print a newline after the output.
  - "System.print()"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because `System.print()` is not a valid method.
  - "print()"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because `print()` is not a valid method by itself in Java.

### Question 51
**Which of the following is used to terminate the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration?**

- **Correct Answer: "continue"**
  - **Explanation:** The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.
- **Other Options:**
  - "break"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because `break` terminates the loop entirely.
  - "exit"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because `exit` is not used to control loop iterations.
  - "return"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because `return` exits the current method, not just the loop iteration.

### Question 52
**Which of the following is used to convert a string to a double in Java?**

- **Correct Answer: "Double.parseDouble()"**
  - **Explanation:** The `Double.parseDouble()` method converts a string to a `double`.
- **Other Options:**
  - "String.toDouble()"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because `String` does not have a `toDouble()` method.
  - "parseDouble()"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because it needs to be called on the `Double` class.
  - "convertToDouble()"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because `convertToDouble()` is not a method in Java.

### Question 53
**What is the output of the following code?**
```java
int x = 10;
if (x > 5) {
    System.out.println("x is greater than 5");
} else {
    System.out.println("x is less than or equal to 5");
}
```

- **Correct Answer: "x is greater than 5"**
  - **Explanation:** The condition `x > 5` is true, so "x is greater than 5" is printed.
- **Other Options:**
  - "x is less than or equal to 5"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because the condition `x > 5` is true.
  - "Compilation error"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because the code is syntactically correct.
  - "Runtime error"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because there is no runtime error in the code.

### Question 54
**What will be the output of the following code?**
```java
int x = 5;
x = x * 2;
System.out.println(x);
```

- **Correct Answer: "10"**
  - **Explanation:** The value of `x` is multiplied by 2, resulting

 in `10`.
- **Other Options:**
  - "5"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because `x` is multiplied by 2.
  - "2"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because the result of the multiplication is `10`, not `2`.
  - "15"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because the result of the multiplication is `10`, not `15`.

### Question 55
**Which of the following is used to create an abstract method in Java?**

- **Correct Answer: "abstract void methodName();"**
  - **Explanation:** The `abstract` keyword is used to declare an abstract method in an abstract class.
- **Other Options:**
  - "void abstract methodName();"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect syntax; the `abstract` keyword should come before the return type.
  - "void methodName() abstract;"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect syntax; the `abstract` keyword should come before the method declaration.
  - "abstract methodName() void;"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect syntax; the `abstract` keyword should come before the return type.

### Question 56
**Which of the following is the correct way to declare a long variable in Java?**

- **Correct Answer: "long l = 100L;"**
  - **Explanation:** The `L` suffix indicates that the literal is a long.
- **Other Options:**
  - "long l = 100;"
    - **Explanation:** This is correct but not the best practice; the `L` suffix is preferred to avoid ambiguity.
  - "long l = \"100\";"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because `"100"` is a string, not a long.
  - "long l = 100.0;"
    - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because `100.0` is a double, not a long.
