# Building a Web Page with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build an interactive web page step by step.

## Chapter 1: Understanding HTML

HTML forms the foundation of our web page. It defines the structure and content using tags.

### Example 1.1: Basic HTML Structure

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Basic Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to the Web Development Tutorial</h1>
    <p>In this tutorial, we will explore HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
````

In this example, we have created a basic HTML structure with a title and a heading. The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration indicates that this is an HTML5 document. The `<html>` tag contains the entire page, while the `<head>` section holds metadata and the `<body>` section contains the visible content.

## Chapter 2: Styling with CSS

CSS adds visual styles to our web page. It transforms the plain HTML into a visually appealing page.

### Example 2.1: Applying Styles with CSS

```html
<head>
  <title>Basic Web Page</title>
  <style>
    body {
      background-color: #f0e8d4;
      font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    }
    h1 {
      color: #8b4513;
      text-align: center;
    }
    p {
      color: #333333;
      font-size: 18px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
```

In this example, we have added a `<style>` block inside the `<head>` section to define the styles for our page. We set the background color of the `<body>` to light brown (`#f0e8d4`) and specified the font family. The `<h1>` heading is styled with a dark brown color (`#8b4513`) and centered alignment. The `<p>` paragraph has a dark gray color (`#333333`) and a font size of 18 pixels.

## Chapter 3: Adding Interactivity with JavaScript

JavaScript adds dynamic behavior and interactivity to our web page.

### Example 3.1: Adding Interactivity with JavaScript

```html
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to the Web Development Tutorial</h1>
  <p>In this tutorial, we will explore HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
  <button onclick="performAction()">Click Me</button>

  <script>
    function performAction() {
      alert("Hello! You clicked the button.");
    }
  </script>
</body>
```

In this example, we have added a `<button>` element with an `onclick` event that triggers the `performAction()` function when clicked. The JavaScript code is placed inside a `<script>` tag. The `performAction()` function displays an alert message, showcasing the interactivity of JavaScript.

## Conclusion

By combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we can create web pages that are both visually appealing and interactive. HTML provides the structure, CSS adds the visual styles, and JavaScript brings interactivity to life.

As you continue learning web development, keep exploring and mastering these technologies. With practice, you'll be able to create professional and engaging web experiences.

Focus on the essential skills and concepts that yield the greatest results. Happy coding!
