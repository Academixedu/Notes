# Tutorial on useState and useEffect Hooks in React

## Introduction

React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class. Two of the most commonly used hooks are `useState` and `useEffect`. This tutorial will cover the basics of these hooks with simple, ready-to-run code examples.

## useState Hook

The `useState` hook lets you add state to functional components. Here's how you can use it:

### Example: Counter

1. Create a new React component called `Counter.js`.

2. Add the following code to `Counter.js`:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  // Declare a state variable named 'count' with an initial value of 0
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

### Explanation

- `useState(0)` initializes the state variable `count` to 0.
- `setCount` is a function that updates the value of `count`.
- The `button`'s `onClick` event calls `setCount(count + 1)` to increment the count.

## useEffect Hook

The `useEffect` hook lets you perform side effects in function components, such as fetching data, directly interacting with the DOM, or setting up subscriptions.

### Example: Fetch Data

1. Create a new React component called `DataFetcher.js`.

2. Add the following code to `DataFetcher.js`:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function DataFetcher() {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Perform a fetch operation when the component mounts
    fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => {
        setData(data);
        setLoading(false);
      });
  }, []); // Empty dependency array means this effect runs only once after the first render

  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Fetched Data</h1>
      <ul>
        {data.slice(0, 10).map(item => (
          <li key={item.id}>{item.title}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default DataFetcher;
```

### Explanation

- `useEffect` takes a function that contains the side effect code.
- The empty array `[]` as the second argument ensures the effect runs only once after the initial render.
- Inside the effect, we fetch data from an API and update the state with `setData`.
- We also set `loading` to `false` after the data is fetched.

## Running the Code

To see these components in action:

1. Ensure you have a React app set up. If not, you can create one using Create React App:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-app
   cd my-app
   ```

2. Add `Counter.js` and `DataFetcher.js` to the `src` folder.

3. Update `App.js` to include these components:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Counter from './Counter';
import DataFetcher from './DataFetcher';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>React Hooks Example</h1>
      <Counter />
      <DataFetcher />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Now you should see a simple application with a counter that increments on button click and a list of data fetched from an API.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we've covered the basics of `useState` and `useEffect` hooks with simple, ready-to-run examples. The `useState` hook is used to manage state in functional components, while the `useEffect` hook is used for side effects such as data fetching. These hooks are powerful tools that enable you to write cleaner and more functional React components.
